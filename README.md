# Parsing XML Data in R

- Identified the parent-child relations of a vast XML database containing publication data of a journal
- Extracted node values using XML package in R and filling the values in separate columns to be able to convert the XML format into two tibbles
- Joined these tibbles with using the dpylr package
- Carried out exploratory data analysis on the table using graphs and visulizations
- Converted the XML file into a text file to perform text analytics for getting deeper insights into the data
