# Parsing XML Data in R

- This code takes you through the process involved in converting an XML data into sturctured data(tibbles)
- Functions are built to extract the child from its root and then put through a loop to fill up the tibble in order
- Further data exploration is carried out using dplyr functions and building various plots
- The XML file is then converted into a text file to carry out regular expression analysis to find specific words in the data
